# Blog-Website
A blog website shares content and engages readers with sections like Home, About, Blog Posts, Categories, and Contact. Opt for a design that reflects your personality with a consistent color scheme and typography. Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Consider a CMS like WordPress for easy content management.
